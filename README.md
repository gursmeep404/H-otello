Otello is a conversational AI-powered property management system tailored for small-scale hospitality providers such as homestays, boutique hotels, hostels, and Airbnb hosts.

These independent hosts often manage between 1–20 rooms and struggle with clunky spreadsheets, manual WhatsApp chats, and fragmented tools. Enterprise-grade Property Management Systems (PMS) are expensive, overly complex, and not mobile/chat-first.

Otello changes that — enabling complete property management through WhatsApp, powered entirely by AI, with no need for dashboards, apps, or technical know-how.
